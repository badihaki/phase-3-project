# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Phase 3 Project: Restaurants, Bartenders, and Cocktails Front-End
## Pitch
This project uses a REACT front-end and a Sinatra-based backend to create a directory of
restaurants, bartenders, and cocktails to search through, create and edit entries.
### Project Story
I've been bartending in Atlanata for the past 3 years, and I've been in the industry too
long. There are a lot of craft cocktails made everyday, and since it is, indeed, a craft,
it'd be nice to see who made it and be able to get the change to meet them at their
restaurant, so I figured I'd make an app to do just that.

### Core Features
I would wish for a directory to look up certain cocktails, attribute those cocktails
to specific bartenders, and show which restaurant has what bartender. For restaurants,
you'd be able to fire your bartender, which removes them from the database, or create
 a whole new restaurant. For bartenders, you'd be able to create a new bartender,
 create a new cocktail, or change your restaurant (before the old one can fire you, ha).
 For all three models (restaurants, bartenders, and cocktails), you'll be able to view
 a list of all of their respective objects.
